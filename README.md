# Home-Lab-SIEM-using-Wazuh
This project demonstrates how to simulate common cyber attacks in a cloud-based environment and detect them using Wazuh SIEM. It showcases a complete security monitoring pipeline, including:

- **Deployment of Wazuh** in a cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, or local VMs)
- **Simulation of real-world attacks** (brute force, privilege escalation, reverse shells, etc.)
- **Configuration of Wazuh** for log collection, threat detection, and alerting
- **Implementation of automated response actions** using Wazuh active responses and rule tuning

The goal is to replicate realistic attack scenarios in a controlled lab, test the effectiveness of Wazuh as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, and build an end-to-end incident detection and response workflow.
